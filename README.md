# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Prompty AI

Welcome to your shiny new [Prompty-enabled](https://prompty.ai)
codespace! 

We've got you all set up to get started on your AI development journey from your first prompt, to a functioning prototype, with this starter template.
 - The `docs` folder contains a structured set of lessons
 - The `labs` folder contains the code for these lessons

Walk through the execises in order to learn about the core concepts, tools, and workflows, for prototyping generative AI applications with Prompty. Then, customize and extend the code to continue learning on your own.

## Quick start

1. Visit this template repository in the browser.
1. Click `Use this template` to create a copy in your profile.
1. Open your copy of the template in the browser.
1. Click the `Code` button, switch to the `Codespaces` tab

## Cleanup

GitHub provides a generous free _monthly_ quota for GitHub Codespaces in terms of CPU and storage. Make sure you stop or delete the Codespaces when you are done, to prevent quota being used unnecessarily.

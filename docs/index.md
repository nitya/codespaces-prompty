# Prompty Workshop

## Learning Objectives

The primary objective is to build developer knowlegde of Prompty:
 - Understand the specification
 - Explore the tooling
 - Use different runtimes

The secondary objective is to give developers a quickstart environment for experimenting with Prompty-based prototyping ideas on their own.
 - Repository is a template you can instantiate repeatedly
 - Configured with devcontainer for pre-built dev environment
 - Launch with GitHub Codespaces (cloud) or Docker desktop (local)
